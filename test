Speaker 1: Is competition an important part of why you like to play video games?
Speaker 2: Yes, I like how competition pushes me to do better. 
Speaker 1: What is it about competition that is motivating?
Speaker 2: I learn from others when they are better than me at a game we are playing. It's a challenge to try to improve.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: It makes games worth playing I guess. I like to learn and progress to new levels.
Speaker 1: Do you prefer games where you are alone against other people or with others (on a team) against other people? 
Speaker 2: I prefer to play games where I am alone.
Speaker 1: Oh I see, like which games?
Speaker 2: Puzzle games are really fun to play alone. I don't know if I really play games alone more than with others though. 
Speaker 1: When playing alone or as part of a team, do you prefer to play against people who are better, the same or worse than you?
Speaker 2: It's always more fun to play against people who are the same as me. I get bored playing if they are worse or better than me.
Speaker 1: Do you prefer direct competition - where you can influence the other person, strategize (like in chess), OR indirect competition - where you cannot influence them, it's primarily about luck (like in bingo, Yahtzee)?
Speaker 2: I like to play with direct competition. Strategy games make me think.
