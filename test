Speaker 1: Is competition an important part of why you like to play video games?
Speaker 2: Yes, I like how competition pushes me to do better. 
Speaker 1: What is it about competition that is motivating?
Speaker 2: I learn from others when they are better than me at a game we are playing. It's a challenge to try to improve.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: It makes games worth playing I guess. I like to learn and progress to new levels.
Speaker 1: Do you prefer games where you are alone against other people or with others (on a team) against other people? 
Speaker 2: I prefer to play games where I am alone. Because like, it is like more fun than like if i was somewhere else. Still i like company. I dont like people. Yeah, not teams. Not any of the teams. I don't like teams because yeah. I do not like teams. 
Speaker 1: Oh I see, like which games?
Speaker 2: Puzzle games are really fun to play alone. I don't know if I really play games alone, more than with others though. 
Speaker 1: When playing alone or as part of a team, do you prefer to play against people who are better, the same or worse than you?
Speaker 2: It's always more fun to play against people who are the same as me. I get bored playing if they are worse or better than me. I think the same is pretty great though, I play against equal competition frequently, equal and same. It like. You know like it. Because like i am. I like it. So like yesterday I went to beach and like, it was really cold. I don't know like how people can go surfing, but I guess they like it. I like the beach, really I do like to go, but like gosh why does it have to be so windy? I thought like, if I brought a sweater it could be alright. I didn't like the wind. I don't like any games. I didn't go very far. I don't like to see any mess.
Speaker 1: Do you prefer direct competition - where you can influence the other person, strategize (like in chess), OR indirect competition - where you cannot influence them, it's primarily about luck (like in bingo, Yahtzee)?
Speaker 2: All kinds of tile based games are fun, they are challenging and make me think. But, hm, I'm not sure.. let me think.. I also like the game Sorry sometimes, but like, it's about luck and it's very fun but that is the only one I can think of. Overall, I don't like very much luck though. It can get kindof like, boring, with just like luck..you know? But I've enjoyed all the strategy games I've played, so yeah direct.
