Applying machine learning to sentiment analysis with a small data set

result is data curation

every data point updates a predictive model
predictive system will adapt, builds up what the optimal prediction method is, given new information
feed whether it made the right decision back into itself

bag of words can be used as a feature to be trained as a classifier 
: amount of negative words, amount of positive words
length of the answer can be a feature 

magnifier, strength words: really or 

bag of words for the how positive
> I wonder if counting the number of positive words vs. their proportion is a better predictor. 
>> I should carry out that analysis by hand and see what the results are
>> there is of course the subjectivity in what I regard as a very positive, etc. 
>> Another feautre that might be interesting to consider is how long the response is
>> Another feautre: # of positive words, # negative words (if I am going to use the Google API for predicting strength of reaction, perhaps LIWC method is suitable)
