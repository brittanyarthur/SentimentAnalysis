Speaker 1:	Okay. So is it ... so would you say it's true that competition is an important part of why you like to play video games?
Speaker 2:	Yes. I would say so.
Speaker 1:	Okay. Um, so in when it comes to competition, what is it that you find motivating? Like, what for you yourself?
Speaker 2:	Well, I think it's like the ... well, I guess there's also [inaudible 00:07:46] to add sort of like personal competition, like getting your personal best.
Speaker 1:	Okay.
Speaker 2:	Um, because I think part of the competition is how it, like, encourages you to get better at it. Um, and these kind of strategy-type games, I think one of the reasons that it's so engaging is because you're ... you can ... you're sort of like acquiring these skills and abilities, um, and getting better at it, and you can play at harder levels. Um, so it's sort of a ... I think that's what's engaging to me about the competition aspect of it. It's sort of kind of motivating in a way, um, to kind of be the person who's always winning.
Speaker 1:	Umm. Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2:	Um, so the more you're winning.
Speaker 1:	Okay.
Speaker 2:	The  more you're getting out of it.
Speaker 1:	Okay. Okay. Um, so do you prefer games where you're alone against other people, or with others on a team against other people?
Speaker 2:	Um, I prefer teams against other people.
Speaker 1:	Okay. It's kind of repetitive. Some of these questions sometimes overlap depending on people's answers, so I apologize if it sounds that way. Um, so when you're playing as part of a team, um, or even the times that you might play alone, do you prefer to play against people who are better, the same, or worse than you?
Speaker 2:	Um, the same.
Speaker 1:	Okay. And do you ... I think I ... was answered by what you said, but do you prefer direct competition where you can influence the other and strategize, or indirect where you can't influence them, it's primarily about luck?
Speaker 2:	That would be direct.
