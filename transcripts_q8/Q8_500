Speaker 2:	No.
Speaker 1:	Yeah.  That's what I'm hearing.  Okay.  Um, so, can you think of any circumstances related to video gaming where competition against others is motivating to you?  Like if you were competing for like money for a good cause or to get a scholarship?  Or something like that?  If it had a different, kind of, quote, unquote, reward at the end?
Speaker 2:	Oh, yeah.  That would change it completely.
Speaker 1:	Yeah?
Speaker 2:	Yeah.
Speaker 1:	How would it change it?
Speaker 2:	Well, I mean, if there was some sort of actual real reward outside of the video game, then that would make me want to, you know … if it was a competition, maybe like, thought I could get good, so maybe I'd want to enter and see if I could do it.  But …
Speaker 1:	Okay.
Speaker 2:	… if it's just for fun, then it's, you know …
Speaker 1:	Okay.
Speaker 2:	… not as important.
