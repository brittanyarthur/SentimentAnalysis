Speaker 1:	So would you say competition is an important part of why you like to play video games?
Speaker 2:	Yes.
Speaker 1:	Okay. So, um, what about it is, is motivating to you, the competition? Is it the winning, being challenged, playing against others, gaining status?
Speaker 2:	Uh, playing against others.
Speaker 1:	Yeah, anything else you ca- that motivates you like to wanna compete in that way or participate in that way?
Speaker 2:	No.
Speaker 1:	No? Okay. Um, so do you prefer games where you’re alone against other people or with others on a team against others?
Speaker 2:	Uh, in teams.
Speaker 1:	Okay.
Speaker 2:	’Cause you have a higher chance of having a higher score when you play with other people.
Speaker 1:	Okay, okay. And when you’re playing alone or as part of a team, it sounds like you’ve done both, do you prefer to play against people who are better, the same or worse than you?
Speaker 2:	The same.
Speaker 1:	Okay. And would you say you like, prefer direct competition where you can influence others, strategize, more like in, like a chess style or indirect where you can’t really influence and it’s primarily about luck, like bingo as, you know, as an example.
Speaker 2:	Mm …
Speaker 1:	Or both, I mean yeah, do you have a …?
Speaker 2:	Well, yeah, every [inaudible 00:07:54] kind of games, so I, I think both.
Speaker 1:	Mm-hmm. So it depends on the game?
Speaker 2:	Yeah.
Speaker 1:	Can you talk more about that?
Speaker 2:	Um, such as say you’re playing Black Ops.
Speaker 1:	Okay.
Speaker 2:	And you’re in, you’re in teams, uh, in that sense you know, you’re winning together and you get to see who is in your team, whereas if you’re playing bingo that is random.
Speaker 1:	Uh-huh.
Speaker 2:	Or, you know, you never know who’s gonna win.
Speaker 1:	Mm-hmm. And you like both of those experiences when you’re playing games?
Speaker 2:	Yes.
